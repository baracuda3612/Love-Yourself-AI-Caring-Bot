# Love Yourself Conceptual Map & Product Bible (v1.2)



1. Core Philosophy — A System Against Chaos

Love Yourself is a structured daily support system designed to reduce decision fatigue and stop the downward spiral of burnout.

It does this by:


giving the day a predictable rhythm,
limiting how many things the user has to think about,
and preventing overload when energy is low.

The goal is not to “push” people to perform.
The goal is to protect their nervous system from collapse by keeping effort inside a safe range.




2. What This Product Is (and Is Not)

This is a self-help system, not medical or clinical treatment.

We:


do not diagnose,
do not prescribe,
do not treat mental illness.

We use well-known psychological and somatic techniques as safe self-regulation tools to help people stabilize, recover energy, and build healthier routines.

These tools can support therapy or recovery — but they do not replace it.




3. Product Glossary

Plan
A structured recovery plan.
It is a “Self-Care Contract” between the user and the system that defines:


how long,
how intense,
and in what way the user will work on themselves.

Exercise (Task)
A small, concrete action designed to create a specific psychological or physiological shift.
These are not generic wellness tips — they are targeted micro-interventions.

Content Library
The closed set of all exercises the system is allowed to use.
We never invent new exercises on the fly.




4. The Anatomy of an Exercise

Every exercise is a standardized, safety-checked unit.

Each one has:


Full Instruction — clear step-by-step guidance on what to do.
Scientific Rationale — based on CBT, ACT, or somatic psychology.
Difficulty Level — Level 1 (easy) to Level 3 (challenging).

These parameters do not change.
They are fixed because they come from real psychological protocols.




5. How Plans Are Built

Every plan is created using three simple choices:

Duration


7 days → short stabilization
21 days → building a new rhythm
90 days → deeper lifestyle change

Focus


Somatic → body-first (good when the mind is overloaded)
Cognitive → mind-first (good for overthinking, perfectionism)
Mixed → balanced

Load


LITE → 1 task per day
MID → 2 tasks per day
INTENSIVE → 3 tasks per day

More load = more slots, not harder exercises. 




6. Cooldown & Repetition

The system enforces cooldown_days — a minimum number of days before the same exercise can repeat.

Why:


the brain adapts quickly,
repetition loses effect,
boredom kills consistency.

Cooldown keeps the nervous system responsive.




7. How the System Handles Missed Tasks

Missed tasks are not treated as failure.

They are treated as data.

If too many tasks are skipped:


the system flags a Red Zone,
and will suggest making the plan lighter or pausing.

This is not punishment.
It is a safety valve.




8. What Users Can Change

Users are always allowed to:


say something feels too hard,
ask for a lighter version,
ask for a different focus,
pause or resume the plan.

What they cannot do is silently rewrite the plan mid-flow.

When a user wants a change, the system creates an adaptation request that the user must explicitly confirm.

This keeps structure from collapsing when motivation dips.




9. Plan Integrity — Who Is Locked, Who Is Free

The “locked plan” rule is not about controlling the user.
It is about controlling the AI.

The user is always free to want changes.
The system is not free to change things impulsively.

A plan is a versioned snapshot of intent.
It stays valid until the user approves an adaptation.

This protects people from:


emotional over-correction,
“just make it easier” spirals,
losing rhythm when things get uncomfortable.

The user is free.
The AI is not.




10. Explain vs Change

There is a strict boundary between:


understanding the plan
and changing the plan

The Coach can:


explain what a plan does,
explain why something was chosen,
explain what each parameter means,
reduce anxiety about the structure.

The Coach cannot:


change load, focus, or duration,
apply changes,
or confirm adaptations.

Only the system can propose changes.
Only the user can approve them.




11. Personalization Without Invention

Every plan is personalized — but only through selection, not invention.

The system:


selects from verified exercises,
based on the user’s energy, focus, and history.

It does not:


invent new exercises,
rewrite instructions,
or alter scientific rationales.

You are not getting random content.
You are getting a custom plan built from a safe, closed toolkit.




🛡 Coach Operating Principles

Explain, don’t execute
You help people understand what is happening.
The system handles the structure.
No judgment
Missed tasks mean the load was wrong — not that the person failed.
Sustainability first
A LITE plan done consistently is worth more than an INTENSIVE plan that breaks someone.
